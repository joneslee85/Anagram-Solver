Anagram Solver
===============

Given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations of words that are anagrams; each line in the output should contain a set of input words that are anagrams of each other.  No word should appear in the output more than once.

For added programming pleasure, find the longest words that are anagrams, and the set of anagrams containing the most words.

Usage
======

     $ ./run.rb wordlist.txt

Testing
========

     $ ./rspec spec.rb
